Below is the data.frame `holiday_movies` containing information about holiday & Christmas movies (Source: [the Internet Movie Database (IMDb)](https://www.imdb.com/)). 

```{r}
pathname <- "https://bcdanl.github.io/data/holiday_movies_w_genres.csv"
holiday_movies <- read_csv(pathname)
```

```{r}
rmarkdown::paged_table(holiday_movies)
```

## Variable Description

- `tconst`: alphanumeric unique identifier of the title

- `title_type`: the type/format of the title 

- `title`: the more popular title / the title used by the filmmakers on promotional materials at the point of release

- `genre`: genre associated with the title

- `year`: the release year of a title

- `runtime_minutes`: primary runtime of the title, in minutes

- `average_rating`: weighted average of all the individual user ratings on IMDb

- `num_votes`: number of votes the title has received on IMDb

## Question 1.
Provide both (1) `ggplot` code and (2) a comment to describe how the relationship between `log10(num_votes)` and `average_rating` varies by `genre`.

*Answer*:
```{r}
ggplot(data = holiday_movies) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = log10(num_votes), y = average_rating),
             alpha = .33) +
   facet_grid(genre ~ .)
                
```
#Q1 Response 
##The relationship bewtween the number of votes and the ratings with genre; Most of the genres have many votes, besides the animation. You can see that most of the time the average rating is around 5-7.5

<br><br>

## Question 2.
Provide both (1) `ggplot` code and (2) a comment to describe how the distribution of `genre` varies by `title_type`.


*Answer*:
```{r}
ggplot(data = holiday_movies) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = 
               aes(y = genre,
                   color = title_type))
```
#Q2 Response 
##The relationship between the genre and title type is that tvMovies is the most popular. 

<br><br>


## Question 3.
Provide both (1) `ggplot` code and (2) a comment to describe how the distribution of `average_rating`, such as quartile values and outliers, varies by `genre` and `title_type`.


*Answer*:
```{r}
ggplot(data = holiday_movies) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = 
                aes(x = average_rating, 
                    y = genre,
                    color = title_type))
```
#Q3 Response
## The relationship between the outliers and quartiles is that the outliers are furthest away from the second quartile. For movies the outliers when they are present they have the greatest distance from the second quartile. 

<br><br>


## Question 4.
Provide both (1) `ggplot` code and (2) a comment to describe how the distribution of `log(num_votes)` varies by `genre`.

*Answer*:
```{r}
ggplot(data = holiday_movies) + 
  geom_col(mapping = 
               aes(x = log(num_votes),
                   y = genre,
                   color = genre)) 
```
#Question 4 Response
## You are able to gather that comedy have the most amount of votes while the animation genre has the least amount of votes. 

<br><br>


## Question 5.
Below is the data.frame, `holiday_movies_genre_yearly`, containing yearly mean value of `average_rating` for each `genre`.

```{r}
holiday_movies_genre_yearly <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/holiday_movies_w_genres_yearly.csv")
```

Provide both (1) `ggplot` code and (2) a comment to describe how the yearly trend of `average_rating` varies by `genre`.



*Answer*:
```{r}

ggplot(data = holiday_movies_genre_yearly) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = 
                aes(x = average_rating, 
                    y = year,
                    color = genre))
                              
                      
```
#Q5 Response
## The data shows that the average rating for romance seemed to get higher in the early 2000's compared to the other genres, which had a higher average rating in the 90's.
